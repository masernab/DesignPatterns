# ðŸŽ¨ Design Patterns in PHP

This repository contains examples of common **Design Patterns** implemented in **PHP**.  
It is meant for learning and quick reference purposes.

## ðŸ“‚ Implemented Patterns

- **Factory Method**  
  Demonstrates how to delegate the instantiation of objects to subclasses using a common interface.  
  Example: Creating different types of keyboards (`WindowsKeyboard`, `MacKeyboard`, `LinuxKeyboard`) depending on the operating system.


- **Abstract Factory**  
  Creates families of related objects without explicitly specifying their concrete classes. This pattern is useful when
  a system needs to be independent from how its products are created, composed, and represented.  
  Example: Create consistent UI elements (Buttons, Checkboxes, Input fields) that match specific operating system
  styles (Windows, MacOS, Linux).
  ```bash
  AbstractFactory
  â”œâ”€â”€ Interfaces/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ UIFactory.php
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Button.php
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Checkbox.php
  â””â”€â”€ Implementations/
      â”œâ”€â”€ WindowsFactory.php
      â”œâ”€â”€ MacFactory.php
      â””â”€â”€ LinuxFactory.php
  ```
  
- **Builder**  
  A creational design pattern that enables step-by-step construction of complex objects with many optional properties.
  The pattern is particularly useful when an object needs to be created with numerous possible configurations.  
  Example: Creating Dragon Ball characters with various optional attributes (name, species, transformations, etc.)
  without the need to specify all parameters or use multiple constructors.
  ```bash
  Builder
  â”œâ”€â”€ Interfaces/
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Builder.php
  â””â”€â”€ Implementations/
      â”œâ”€â”€ DragonBallCharacter.php
      â”œâ”€â”€ DragonBallCharacterBuilder.php
      â””â”€â”€ DragonBallCharacterDirector.php
  ```
